#vid_downloader

A Python Script that helps download videos from websites.
Works for youtube playlists too, if the link to the first video of the playlist is supplied.  
  

downld.py takes the list of links as an input from a file named vid_list, and recodes it into mp4 format.  
It saves the downloaded video with the name of the original youtube video's title.
