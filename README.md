## Description
A Simple Python Script that helps download videos from websites. 

Provide a link to the video you wish to download and it automatically does all the hard work for you! Specify the path where you choose to save the file, so that it gets downloaded there. If you're only interested in the audio format that can be done too!

Works for youtube playlists too, if the link to the first video of the playlist is supplied.  
  
The downld.py takes the *list* of links as an *input from a file* named vid_list, and recodes it into mp4 format.  
It saves the downloaded video with the name of the original youtube video's title.

The audio.py takes in the url of the video you wish to get the audio of, and downloads the audio of that video.
